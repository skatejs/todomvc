If not specified this tries\n    // to `require('gulp')` for you.\n    gulp: gulp\n});\n```\n\nAnd in `./build/gulp/my-task.js`\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function myTask () {\n  // do something tasky\n};\n```\n\n### Why?\n\nSeveral reasons.\n\n1. All your tasks become *true* modules. No more `gulp.task` inside of your module.\n2. Since they're now just normal modules that export functions, they can be reused.\n3. Enforces usage of good, existing conventions.\n4. Finding a task is easy because it is based off the file path. No more \"where the f**k is that task?\" because it's nested in some file with a bunch of other tasks.\n5. Small `gulpfile`.\n6. Use something like https://github.com/pahen/madge to map your dependencies.\n\n### Defining Task Dependencies\n\nYou can define dependencies for a task in the normal, could-be-better, Gulp way using names. To do this, add a `deps` array to your task function:\n\n```js\nfunction myTask () {\n  // tasky task\n}\n\nmyTask.deps = ['task1', 'task2'];\n```\n\nHowever, this is not recommended. Why you ask? Because:\n\n1. Want to find out why some task was run but it's not a direct dependency of the task you currently ran? Follow the dependency chain. Manually.\n2. Do you have multiple tasks per file? Good luck.\n3. Your tasks are run in parallel. Good for lots of things, but not everything.\n4. If you want to run your tasks in serial, you must go and return explicitly from the task. Wait now that task can't be reused to run in parallel.\n\nIf you don't mind those things, that's cool. It's there for you to use. But... there's a better way.\n\n### Defining async tasks\n\nYou can define async tasks like this:\n\n```js\nfunction myAsyncTask (opts, done) {\n  // async tasky task\n  done();\n}\n```\n\n### Using with [mac](https://github.com/treshugart/mac)\n\nMac gives you a way to chain a bunch of Gulp streams in parallel, or in series, using only the task function you've defined. The only thing you've got to make sure that you do is to return your stream from your task and it can be reused wherever.\n\nCheck out the [build example](https://github.com/treshugart/mac#build-example) for more information.\n\n### Private Tasks\n\nIf you have some tasks in your build directory that you do not want auto-tasked (they may not conform to the gulp-auto-task convention), set `module.exports.autotask` to `false`, ie:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports.private = true;\n```\n\nYou can then use regular gulp tasks and auto-gulp-task's simultaneously.\n",
