## Implementation

This implementation of TodoMVC uses [SkateJS](https://github.com/skatejs/skatejs) along with [SkateJS DOM Diff](https://github.com/skatejs/dom-diff) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) to remove a lot of the boilerplate and state maintenance invoved with the [vanilla app](https://github.com/skatejs/todomvc/tree/skatejs/examples/skatejs). The result is a more functional set of components that is very similar to React.

Since it utilises future JavaScript features and JSX, it requries a transpile in order to dev, but you should be able to start a server and load up the `index.html` and have a working example.
