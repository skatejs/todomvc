To see the README for the last stable release select it from the list of tags.*\n\n# Skate\n\nSkate is a web component library that provides an API to bind behaviour to DOM elements. It's based on the W3C specification for Custom Elements.\n\n- Provides a superset of the [Custom Element Spec](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/).\n- Hooks for the spec'd lifecycle, templating, custom properties and event delegation.\n- Small, 5k min+gz.\n- Allows easy transition from selector-based behaviour binding to element binding.\n\n*Skate will soon be joining the [jQuery Foundation Project Incubator](https://jquery.org/) and will be helping to define that process moving forward. Nothing will change for users or contributors before, during or after the transition.*\n\nHTML\n\n```html\n<my-element></my-element>\n```\n\nJavaScript\n\n```js\nskate('my-element', {\n  created: function (elem) {\n    elem.textContent = 'Hello, World!';\n  }\n});\n```\n\nResult\n\n```html\n<my-element>Hello, World!</my-element>\n```\n\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n\n\n- [Compatibility](#compatibility)\n- [Installing](#installing)\n  - [UMD (AMD / CommonJS)](#umd-amd--commonjs)\n  - [ES6 Modules](#es6-modules)\n  - [Global](#global)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Component Lifecycle](#component-lifecycle)\n- [Event Binding](#event-binding)\n- [Constructing Elements](#constructing-elements)\n  - [Function Call](#function-call)\n  - [`skate.create()`](#skatecreate)\n  - [Constructor](#constructor)\n  - [Hydrating Properties](#hydrating-properties)\n- [Extending Elements](#extending-elements)\n- [Custom Methods and Properties](#custom-methods-and-properties)\n- [Asynchrony](#asynchrony)\n- [API](#api)\n  - [`create (componentName, elementProperties = {})`](#create-componentname-elementproperties--)\n    - [Alternatives](#alternatives)\n    - [Setting properties](#setting-properties)\n    - [Why not just patch `document.createElement()`?](#why-not-just-patch-document-createelement-)\n  - [`emit (element, eventName, eventOptions = {})`](#emit-eventname-eventoptions--)\n  - [`fragment (...almostAnything)`](#fragment-almostanything)\n  - [`init (...elements)`](#init-elements)\n  - [`noConflict ()`](#noconflict-)\n  - [`ready (elementOrElements, callback)`](#ready-elementorelements-callback)\n    - [Background](#background)\n    - [The problem](#the-problem)\n    - [The solution](#the-solution)\n    - [Drawbacks](#drawbacks)\n  - [`render (element)`](#render-element)\n  - [`render.html(renderFunction)`](#renderhtmlrenderfunction)\n    - [Writing your own renderers](#writing-your-own-renderers)\n  - [`version`](#version)\n- [Web Component Differences](#web-component-differences)\n- [Transitioning Away from jQuery-style Plugins](#transitioning-away-from-jquery-style-plugins)\n- [Native Support](#native-support)\n- [Polyfills](#polyfills)\n- [Preventing FOUC](#preventing-fouc)\n- [Ignoring Elements](#ignoring-elements)\n- [No Conflict](#no-conflict)\n- [Multiple Version Support](#multiple-version-support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n  - [Setup](#setup)\n  - [Testing](#testing)\n  - [Linting](#linting)\n  - [Distribution](#distribution)\n  - [Releasing](#releasing)\n  - [Deploying](#deploying)\n- [Who's Using It?](#whos-using-it)\n- [Maintainers](#maintainers)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\nSee the Sauce Labs badge at the top.\n\n\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you have any questions about Skate, feel free to join the public [HipChat room](https://www.hipchat.com/gB3fMrnzo) and @mention a member.\n\n\n\n## Installing\n\nYou can download the source yourself and put it wherever you want. Additionally you can use Bower:\n\n    bower install skatejs\n\nOr NPM:\n\n    npm install skatejs\n\nOr JSPM:\n\n    jspm install npm:skatejs\n\nInclude either `dist/skate.js` or `dist/skate.min.js`.\n\n\n\n### UMD (AMD / CommonJS)\n\nUMD files are located in `lib/`. Simply `require` the `lib/index.js` file by whatever means you have and use it in accordance with whatever loader you've chosen.\n\n\n\n### ES6 Modules\n\nThe Skate source is written using [ES6 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html). If you're using a transpilation method, then you can `import skate from 'src/index';` and use it in your projects as you would any ES6 module.\n\n\n\n### Global\n\nIf you're still skating old school the `dist` directory contains the compiled ES5 source. The compiled source does not use a module loader; everything will just work. Access Skate as a global with `skate`.\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nYou define a component by passing a component ID and definition to the `skate()` function. The ID you specify corresponds to one of the following:\n\n- Tag name\n- Value of the `is` attribute\n- Attribute name\n- Class name\n\nThe definition is an object of options that define your component.\n\n```js\nskate('my-element', {\n  // Lifecycle Callbacks\n\n  // Called before the element is set up. Descendants components may or may not\n  // be initialised yet.\n  created: function (elem) {},\n\n  // Called when the element is attached to the document.\n  attached: function (elem) {},\n\n  // Called when the element is detached from the document.\n  detached: function (elem) {},\n\n  // Gets called after the host element (this component) is is ready to be\n  // interacted with. Both `created` and `render` will be called prior to this\n  // being called. Descendants, however, may not be ready yet. If you need to\n  // interact with descendants, use the `skate.ready()` function.\n  ready: function (elem) {},\n\n  // Responsible for rendering stuff to the host element. This can do anything\n  // you like.\n  render: function (elem) {\n    elem.innerHTML = 'Hello, World!';\n  },\n\n  // Called when an attribute is created, updated or removed.\n  attribute: function (elem, data) {\n    if (data.oldValue === undefined) {\n      // created\n    } else if (data.newValue === undefined) {\n      // removed\n    } else {\n      // updated\n    }\n  },\n\n  // Event Listeners\n  events: {\n    // All direct and bubbled events.\n    click: function (e) {\n      // Refers to the component element.\n      this;\n\n      // Standard DOM event object.\n      e;\n\n      // Same as `this`.\n      e.delegateTarget;\n    },\n\n    // Restricted to events triggered only on the component element. Arguments\n    // are the same as above.\n    'click my-element': function (e) {},\n\n    // Event delegation.\n    'click .something': function (e) {\n      // Same as above.\n      this && e;\n\n      // Instead matches whatever `.something` is.\n      e.delegateTarget;\n    },\n\n    // Multiple handlers.\n    click: [\n      handler1,\n      handler2\n    ],\n\n    // Focus and blur can be delegated, too.\n    'focus .something': function () {},\n    'blur .something': function () {}\n  },\n\n\n\n  // Extending Elements\n  //\n  // Restricts a particular component to binding explicitly to an element with\n  // a tag name that matches the specified value. This value is empty by\n  // default.\n  //\n  // Depending on the component type, it behaves like so:\n  //\n  // - When applied to a custom element, the component ID is used to match the\n  //   value of the element's `is` attribute and the element's tag name is\n  //   matched against the value specified here. This conforms with the custom\n  //   element spec.\n  //\n  // - When given to a component that binds to an element using an attribute,\n  //   the value specified here must match the element's tag name.\n  //\n  // - When specified on a component that is bound using a class name, this\n  //   value must match the element's tag name.\n  //\n  // - If the value is empty, then the component is not restricted at all.\n  extends: '',\n\n\n\n  // Custom Property Descriptors\n  properties: {\n    prop1: {\n      // Two-way binding to attributes. Changes to this property propagate to\n      // its corresponding attribute and changes to its corresponding attribute\n      // are propagated to the property.\n      //\n      // This defaults to `false`. If you specify `true` the property name is\n      // dash-cased and used as the attribute it should keep in sync with. If\n      // you specify a `string`, it is used as the attribute name.\n      attribute: false,\n\n      // Serializes the property value when it is set so that it can be stored\n      // as an attribute value. This only is called if this property is linked\n      // to an attribute.\n      serialize: function (value) {},\n\n      // Deserializes the attribute value when it is set so that it can be\n      // set as the property value. This only is called if this property is\n      // linked to an attribute.\n      deserialize: function (value) {},\n\n      // A function that gets called before `set()`. It's up to you what you do\n      // here. You can log, warn, or throw an exception if an unacceptable value\n      // is detected. If you simply want to coerce the value, return the coerced\n      // value. You *must* return a value from this. If you don't return, then\n      // the coerced value becomes `undefined`.\n      coerce: function (value) {}\n\n      // This will be used as the default value for the property. If you specify\n      // a function then it will be invoked and the return value will be used.\n      // This option will also be used in place of the value returned from the\n      // `get()` option if it returns `undefined`. This does not override any\n      // values present on the element when at the time it is initialised.\n      default: 'default value'\n\n      // Custom getter. The return value is used as the property value when\n      // retrieved. If you don't specify a getter, the value that it was set as\n      // is returned regardless of if you've specified a setter.\n      //\n      // The getter is passed a single argument which is the element in which\n      // the property was accessed.\n      //\n      // To make a property \"readonly\", specify a getter without a setter.\n      get: function (element) {},\n\n      // Custom setter. Set value as you see fit. Return value is ignored. If\n      // you don't specify a getter, then whatever `newValue` was passed in to\n      // the setter, is returned when you access the property.\n      // You receive two arguments:\n      //\n      // - `element` The element that the property is being set on.\n      // - `changeData` Information about the change.\n      //\n      // The `changeData` property has three entries:\n      //\n      // - `name`\n      // - `newValue`\n      // - `oldValue`\n      //\n      // If you set the value to the same value that the property already\n      // is, then the setter is still triggered. However, both `newValue` and\n      // `oldValue` will be the same value.\n      set: function (element, changeData) {}\n    }\n  },\n\n\n\n  // Custom Methods and Properties\n  //\n  // This behaves just like any prototype object does. All methods and\n  // properties are added to the element's prototype (native), or to the element\n  // instance during the `created` lifecycle (polyfill).\n  //\n  // It's recommended you use the `properties` option for all public-api\n  // properties, but nothing is stopping you from putting them here if you\n  // don't need the special behaviour of `properties`.\n  prototype: {\n    get someProperty () {},\n    someMethod: function () {}\n  },\n\n\n  // Component Types\n  //\n  // The type of component this is. By default, this makes your component\n  // conform to the custom element spec, but you can use custom types if\n  // required.\n  //\n  // Alternate binding types: https://github.com/skatejs/types\n  type: {}\n\n\n\n  // Preventing FOUC\n  //\n  // The `resolved` and `unresolved` attributes allow you to style a resolved\n  // or unresolved component. You can changes these if you want to use different\n  // names.\n\n  // The attribute name to add after calling the `created` callback.\n  resolvedAttribute: 'resolved',\n\n  // The attribute name to remove after calling the `created` callback.\n  unresolvedAttribute: 'unresolved'\n});\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Component Lifecycle\n\nThe component lifecycle consists of several paths in the following order starting from when the element is first created.\n\n1. `prototype` is set up in non-native (alread set up in native)\n2. `events` are set up\n3. `properties` are defined\n4. `created` is invoked\n5. `render` is invoked to render an HTML structure to the component\n6. `properties` are initialised\n7. `ready` is invoked\n8. `attached` is invoked when added to the document (or if already in the document)\n9. `detached` is invoked when removed from the document\n10. `attribute` is invoked whenever an attribute is updated\n\nEach callback gets the element passed in as the first argument. The attribute callback gets an additional argument with information about the change:\n\n```js\nskate('my-element', {\n  attribute: function (element, change) {\n    if (change.oldValue === undefined) {\n      // created\n    } else if (change.newValue === undefined) {\n      // removed\n    } else {\n      // updated\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe change object contains the following properties:\n\n- `name` The name of the attribute that was changed.\n- `newValue` The new value of the attribute.\n- `oldValue` The old value of the attribute.\n\nThe `attribute` callback is fired whenever an element attribute is created, updated or removed, but not if the attribute already exists on the element when it is first initialised. This is synonymous with the `attributeChangedCallback` in the web component spec. The only differences are:\n\n- Undefined attribute values are normalised to be `undefined` instead of `null` to be consistent across the board.\n- The function signature is different: the element is the first argument and the parameters are consolidated into a change object.\n\n\n\n## Event Binding\n\n```js\nskate('my-element', {\n  events: {\n    // All direct and bubbled events.\n    click: function (e) {\n      // Refers to the component element.\n      this;\n\n      // Standard DOM event object.\n      e;\n\n      // Same as `this`.\n      e.delegateTarget;\n    },\n\n    // Restricted to events triggered only on the component element. Arguments\n    // are the same as above.\n    'click my-element': function (e) {},\n\n    // Event delegation.\n    'click .something': function (e) {\n      // Same as above.\n      this && e;\n\n      // Instead matches whatever `.something` is.\n      e.delegateTarget;\n    },\n\n    // Multiple handlers.\n    click: [\n      handler1,\n      handler2\n    ],\n\n    // Focus and blur can be delegated, too.\n    'focus .something': function () {},\n    'blur .something': function () {}\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n\n## Constructing Elements\n\nThere's several different ways to construct an element.\n\n### Function Call\n\n```js\nvar myElement = skate('my-element', {});\nvar myElementInstance = myElement();\n```\n\n### `skate.create()`\n\n```js\nskate('my-element', {});\nvar myElementInstance = skate.create('my-element');\n```\n\n### Constructor\n\nWhile not the most elegant way, this serves as an ode to the spec.\n\n```js\nvar MyElement = skate('my-element');\nvar myElementInstance = new MyElement();\n```\n\n### Hydrating Properties\n\nFor each of the ways you can construct an element, Skate also allows you to pass a properties object to them. The properties object is used to hydrate property values for the element.\n\n```js\nvar props = { propname: 'propvalue' };\nvar myElementInstance = myElement(props);\nvar myElementInstance = skate.create('my-element', props);\nvar myElementInstance = new MyElement(props);\n```\n\n\n\n## Extending Elements\n\nYou may extend components using ES6 classes or your favorite ES5 library.\n\n```js\nvar XParent = skate('x-parent', {\n  static created () {\n\n  }\n  static get events {\n    return {\n      event1 () {}\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nvar XChild = skate('x-child', class extends XParent {\n  static created () {\n    super.created();\n  }\n  static get events {\n    return class extends super.events {\n      event1 (e) {\n        super.event1(e);\n      }\n      event2 () {\n\n      }\n    };\n  }\n});\n```\n\nDue to the semantics of ES6 classes, you must specify any non-prototype members as static. ES6 classes also do not support the object literal syntax. In order to specify properties, just use the getter syntax like we did with `events` above.\n\n\n\n## Custom Methods and Properties\n\nSkate gives you the option to specify custom properties and methods on your component.\n\n```js\nskate('my-component', {\n  prototype: {\n    callMeLikeAnyNativeMethod: function () {}\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThese members are applied directly to the element instance that your component is bound to so you can do stuff like this:\n\n```js\ndocument.getElementById('my-component-id').callMeLikeanyNativeMethod();\n```\n\n\n\n## Asynchrony\n\nDue to the fact that Skate uses Mutation Observers - and polyfills it for older browsers - elements are processed asynchronously. This means that if you insert an element into the DOM, custom methods and properties on that element will not be available right away. This will not work:\n\n```js\ndocument.body.innerHTML = '<my-component id=\"my-component-id\"></my-component>';\n\ndocument.getElementById('my-component-id').someCustomMethod();\n```\n\nThis is because the component will not be processed until after the block this code is in releases control back to the JavaScript engine. If you need to use the element right away, you must explicitly initialise it in a synchronous manner using `skate.init()`:\n\n```js\nvar element = document.getElementById('my-component-id');\n\nskate.init(element);\n\nelement.someCustomMethod();\n```\n\nThis is very useful during testing, but can be used for any use case that requires synchronous operation.\n\n\n\n## API\n\nThe following are all available on the `skate` object, or available for use from the `src/api` or `lib/api` folders.\n\n\n\n### `create (componentName, elementProperties = {})`\n\nCreates an element for the specified component `name`, ensures that it's synchronously initialized and assigns all `props` to it. On the surface, this doesn't appear much different than `document.createElement()` in browsers that support custom elements, however, there's several benefits that it gives you on top of being a single, consistent and convenient way to do things in any browser and environment.\n\nFor example, this can be called in any browser and it will behave consistently:\n\n```js\nskate.create('my-element');\n```\n\nIn browsers that support custom elements, it is equivalent to:\n\n```js\ndocument.createElement('my-element');\n```\n\nIn browsers that do not support custom elements, you would have to manually ensure that the element is initialised synchronously:\n\n```js\nvar element = document.createElement('my-element');\nskate.init(element);\n```\n\nTo take this example further, if we've extended an element:\n\n```js\nskate('my-element', {\n  extends: 'div'\n});\n```\n\nHow we call this function does not change:\n\n```js\nskate.create('my-element');\n```\n\nHowever, in native land this does change:\n\n```js\ndocument.createElement('div', 'my-element');\n```\n\nAnd in polyfill land, it's much different:\n\n```js\nvar element = document.createElement('div');\nelement.setAttribute('is', 'my-element');\nskate.init(element);\n```\n\nBoth the native and polyfilled examples above expose too many implementation details. It's much better to have one simple and consistent way to create an element.\n\n#### Alternatives\n\nIf you have access to the function / constructor returned from the `skate()` call, invoking that does the same exact thing as `skate.create()`:\n\n```js\nvar myElement;\nvar MyElement = skate('my-element', {});\n\n// Same thing:\nmyElement = skate.create('my-element');\nmyElement = MyElement();\nmyElement = new MyElement();\n```\n\n#### Setting Properties\n\nAll methods of constructing an element support passing properties.\n\n```js\nmyElement = skate.create('my-element', { prop: 'value' });\nmyElement = MyElement({ prop: 'value' });\nmyElement = new MyElement({ prop: 'value' });\n```\n\nPassing properties automatically assigns them to the element:\n\n```js\n// 'value'\nconsole.log(myElement.prop);\n```\n\n#### Why not just patch `document.createElement()`?\n\nSkate is designed to work with multiple versions of itself on the same page. If one version patches `document.createElement()` differently than another, then you have problems. Even if we did do this, how `document.createElement()` is called still depends on how the corresponding component has been registered, which is bad, especially when we can infer that information from the component definition.\n\n\n\n#### `emit (element, eventName, eventOptions = {})`\n\nEmits a `CustomEvent` on `element` that `bubbles` and is `cancelable` by default. This is useful for use in components that are children of a parent component and need to communicate changes to the parent.\n\n```js\nskate('x-tabs', {\n  events: {\n    selected: hideAllAndShowSelected\n  }\n});\n\nskate('x-tab', {\n  events: {\n    click: function () {\n      skate.emit(this, 'selected');\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIt's preferrable not to reach up the DOM hierarchy because that couples your logic to a specific DOM structure that the child has no control over. To decouple this so that your child can be used anywhere, simply trigger an event.\n\n#### Emitting Several Events at Once\n\nYou can emit more than one event at once by passing a space-separated string or an array as the `eventName` parameter:\n\n```js\nskate.emit(element, 'event1 event2');\nskate.emit(element, [ 'event1', 'event2' ]);\n```\n\n#### Return Value\n\nThe native `element.dispatchEvent()` method returns `false` if the event was cancelled. Since `skate.emit()` can trigger more then one event, a `Boolean` return value is ambiguous. Instead it returns an `Array` of the event names that were canceled.\n\n#### Preventing Bubbling or Canceling\n\nIf you don't want the event to bubble, or you don't want it to be cancelable, then you can specify those options in the `eventOptions` argument.\n\n```js\nskate.emit(element, 'event', {\n  bubbles: false,\n  cancelable: false\n});\n```\n\n\n\n### `fragment (...almostAnything)`\n\nCreates a document fragment from the specified node or HTML string and ensures any components within the fragment are synchronously initialised.\n\nYou can pass a DOM node:\n\n```js\nskate.fragment(document.createElement('my-element'));\n```\n\nA string:\n\n```js\nskate.fragment('<my-element></my-element>');\n```\n\nAny traversible item:\n\n```js\nskate.fragment([document.createElement('my-element'), '<my-element></my-element>']);\n```\n\nOr a combination of those:\n\n```js\nskate.fragment(\n  document.createElement('my-element'),\n  '<my-element></my-element>',\n  [document.createElement('my-element'), '<my-element></my-element>']\n);\n```\n\nYou are returned a document fragment that contains synchronously initialised components (if you added any components). It's just a normal `DocumentFragment` so you can do anything you would normally be able to do. However, it should be noted that the methods aren't decorated to sync init components that you add after calling `skate.fragment()`.\n\nIf you want to add components that are synchronously initialised, you can just chain `skate.fragment()` calls:\n\n```js\nskate\n  .fragment('<my-element></my-element>')\n  .appendChild(skate.fragment('<my-other-element></my-other-element>'));\n```\n\n\n### `init (...elements)`\n\nIt's encouraged that you use `skate.create()` and `skate.fragment()` for creating elements and ensuring that they're synchronously initialised, however, there are edge-cases where synchronously initialising an existing element `skate.init()` may be necessary.\n\n```js\nskate.init(element1, element2);\n```\n\n*You shouldn't use skate.init() in native to ensure descendant DOM is initialised as there's stuff native does that we don't emulate with it. See the docs on `skate.ready()` for how you can interact with descendant components after they've been upgraded.*\n\n\n\n### `noConflict ()`\n\nSame as what you'd come to expect from most libraries that offer a global namespace. It will restore the value of `window.skate` to the previous value and return the current `skate` object.\n\n```js\nvar currentSkate = skate.noConflict();\n```\n\n*No conflict mode is only available from the version in `dist/` since that's the only version that exports a global.*\n\n\n\n### `ready (elementOrElements, callback)`\n\nThe `skate.ready()` function should not be confused with the `ready` lifecycle callback. The lifecycle callback is called when the component element is ready to be worked with. It means that it's been templated out and all properties have been set up completely. It does not mean, however, that descendant components have been initialised.\n\n#### Background\n\nYou maybe thinking \"that sucks, why wouldn't they have been initialised?\" That's a very good question. In order to realise the problem, we must first know how native custom elements behave.\n\nIf you put your component definitions before your components in the DOM loading `component-a` before `component-b`:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"component-a.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"component-b.js\"></script>\n<component-a>\n  <component-b></component-b>\n</component-a>\n```\n\nThe initialisation order will be:\n\n1. `component-a`\n2. `component-b`\n\nIf you flip that around so that `component-b` is loaded before `component-a`, the order is the same. This is because the browser will initialise elements with their corresponding definitions as it descends the DOM tree.\n\nHowever, if you put your component definitions at the bottom of the page, it gets really hairy. For example:\n\n```html\n<component-a>\n  <component-b></component-b>\n</component-a>\n<script src=\"component-a.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"component-b.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIn this example, we are loading `component-a` before `component-b` and the same order will apply. *However*, if you flip that around so that `component-b` is loaded before `component-a`, then `component-b` will be initialised first. This is because when a definition is registered via `document.registerElement()`, it will look for elements to upgrade *immediately*.\n\n#### The problem\n\nIf you want `component-a` to be able to rely on `component-b` being initialised, you'd have to put some constraints on your consumers:\n\n- If you're running native, you must load your definitions at the bottom of the page. You must also ensure that you're loading `component-b` before `component-a`. You could use a module loader to ensure `component-b` is imported by `component-a`, but you still have the constraint of making the consumer load the definitions at the bottom of the page.\n- If you're running in polyfill land, just make sure that you load `component-b` before `component-a`. As above, you could just use a module loader for this.\n\nThe problem here is that your consumer is now concerned with implementation details and have constraints placed on them that they shouldn't have to worry about.\n\n#### The solution\n\nIf you want to do something when `component-b` is initialised, you can use `skate.ready()`.\n\n```js\nskate('component-a', {\n  created: function (elem) {\n    var b = elem.querySelector('component-b');\n\n    // undefined\n    b.initialised;\n\n    // Your selected elements are passed to the callback as the first argument.\n    skate.ready(elem.querySelector('component-b'), function (b) {\n      // true\n      b.initialised;\n    });\n  },\n  render: function (elem) {\n    elem.innerHTML = '<component-b></component-b>';\n  }\n});\n\nskate('component-b', {\n  created: function (elem) {\n    elem.initialised = true;\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Drawbacks\n\nThis does not solve the situation where you want to be notified of future elements that may be added somewhere in your descendant DOM. That is more a concern of what API you choose to expose to your consumers, the rendering path you choose and the problem you're trying to solve. This only concerns itself with the descendant nodes that you *know* exist. Most of the time this will come from the `render` lifecycle callback.\n\n\n\n### `render (element)`\n\nRenders invokes the `render()` lifecycle callback on the specified element for the components that are bound to it. If no components are found for the element, nothing happens.\n\n```js\nvar hello = skate('x-hello', {\n  render: function (elem) {\n    elem.innerHTML = `Hello, ${elem.name || 'World'}!`;\n  }\n});\n\n// <x-hello>Hello, World!</x-hello>\nvar elem = hello();\n\n// <x-hello>Hello, Bob!</x-hello>\nelem.name = 'Bob';\nskate.render(elem);\n```\n\nThis makes it extremely useful when using properties because you can rewrite the above component to re-render itself while taking advantave of all that `properties` has to offer:\n\n```js\nvar hello = skate('x-hello', {\n  properties: {\n    name: {\n      attribute: true,\n      default: 'World',\n      set: skate.render\n    }\n  },\n  render: function (elem) {\n    elem.innerHTML = `Hello, ${elem.name}!`;\n  }\n});\n\n// <x-hello name=\"World\">Hello, World!</x-hello>\nvar elem = hello();\n\n// <x-hello name=\"Bob\">Hello, Bob!</x-hello>\nelem.name = 'Bob';\n```\n\n*If you are using the polyfill and are using custom bindings (i.e. classes and attributes) then it will invoke `render()` in each of those if they are specified. It's recommended that you only bind one component that does rendering otherwise the result is not predictable. It's up to component authors to write components that follow best practices and it's up to component consumers to use components that follow best practices.*\n\n\n\n### `render.html(renderFunction)`\n\nThis function exists for a simple, default way to render content to your host component. It doesn't do any special diffing or anything, it simply removes all current nodes and adds the new ones. You can return a document fragment, node or string (that will be converted to nodes).\n\n```js\nvar hello = skate('x-hello', {\n  render: skate.render.html(function (elem) {\n    return `Hello, ${elem.name || 'World'}!`;\n  })\n});\n```\n\nUsing this is good for simple components, or components where you're using properties to mutate the template that you render from here. Functional UI proponents won't like this method, but this offers the simplest, least opinionated method to build a component as Skate strives to have as little opinion about this as possible.\n\nIf you want to re-render your entire component but have it only update the parts that need updating, you can use something like [skatejs-dom-diff](https://github.com/skatejs/dom-diff) in a custom renderer. For more information, see the next section.\n\n#### Writing your own renderers\n\nWriting your own renderers consists of writing a function that returns a function:\n\n```js\nfunction render (renderFn) {\n  return function (elem) {\n    elem.innerHTML = renderFn(elem);\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAnd you could use it like so:\n\n```js\nrender: render(function (elem) {\n  return `Hello, ${elem.name || 'World'}!`;\n});\n```\n\nIf you wanted to do something a little bit more complex, you could use something like [skatejs-dom-diff](https://github.com/skatejs/dom-diff) as stated at the end of the previous section:\n\n```js\nfunction render (renderFn) {\n  return function (elem) {\n    skateDomDiff.merge({\n      destination: skate.fragment(renderFn(elem)),\n      source: elem\n    });\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAnd you could use it in the exact same way as used above. The only difference being that it will only update the parts of your element's tree that changed. Everything else stays intact as it was before.\n\n\n\n\n### `version`\n\nReturns the current version of Skate.\n\n\n\n## Web Component Differences\n\nSkate implements the [Custom Element spec](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/) with a custom API but it does not polyfill the native methods. Since Skate is a custom element library, it does not polyfill [ShadowDOM](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/) or [HTML Imports](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/).\n\nYou can do some pretty cool things with Skate that you can't do with Web Components. For example, you can write polyfills for existing elements:\n\n`<datalist>...</datalist>`:\n\n```js\nskate('datalist', {\n  created: polyfillDatalistElement\n});\n```\n\n`<input placeholder=\"\">`:\n\n```js\nvar typeAttribute = require('skatejs-type-attribute');\n\nskate('placeholder', {\n  extends: 'input',\n  type: typeAttribute,\n  created: polyfillInputPlaceholder\n});\n```\n\n`<input type=\"date\">`:\n\n```js\nvar typeAttribute = require('skatejs-type-attribute');\n\nskate('type', {\n  extends: 'input',\n  type: typeAttribute,\n  properties: {\n    type: {\n      set: function (element, change) {\n        if (change.newValue === 'date') {\n          makeIntoDatepicker(element);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n`<link rel=\"import\" href=\"path/to/import.html\">` (HTML Imports):\n\n```js\nvar typeAttribute = require('skatejs-type-attribute');\n\nskate('rel', {\n  extends: 'link',\n  type: typeAttribute,\n  properties: {\n    rel: {\n      set: function (element, change) {\n        if (change.newValue === 'import') {\n          makeIntoHtmlImport(element);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n\n## Custom bindings\n\nSkate supports custom bindings such as the ability to bind functionality to elements that have a particular attribute or classname. This comes in handy when wanting to work with legacy code that uses class / attribute selectors to bind stuff to elements on `DOMContentLoaded` because it negates the need to use selectors and / or `DOMContentLoaded` altogether. Not only does this have added performance benefits because you're not running selectors or blocking, it also means that you don't have to run any manual initialisation code. Just write your HTML and things happen.\n\nThe actual binding functionality isn't built into Skate. Skate simply offers an API for you to use custom bindings that you or others have written. If you want to write a binding, all you have to do is provided a particular interface for Skate to call.\n\n```js\nvar myCustomBidning = {\n  create: function (componentDefinition) {\n    // Create an element matching the component definition.\n  },\n  filter: function (element, componentDefinitions) {\n    // Return an array of definitions that the element should initialise with.\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThere's some that we've already built for you over at https://github.com/skatejs/types.\n\n### Considerations\n\nThere's a few things that you must consider when building and using custom bindings:\n\n#### 1. You're deviating from the spec.\n\nSkate will always be a superset of the custom element spec. This means that core-Skate will never stray too far from the spec other than offering a more convenient API and featureset.\n\n#### 2. Performance\n\nThe `filter` callback is performance-critical. This function *must* be run for every single element that comes into existence. Be wary of this.\n\n#### 3. With great power comes great responsibility\n\nNo matter if we decided to expose this as API or not, we'd still have to do a similar algorithm behind the scenes. Since there are many use-cases where writing a component with the Skate API is useful, we felt it was best to offer safe, spec-backed defaults while giving developers a little bit of breathing room.\n\n\n\n## Transitioning Away from jQuery-style Plugins\n\nBecause Skate supports custom bindings as mentioned above, it allows you to do things like refactor your jQuery initialisation code without touching any HTML:\n\n```js\njQuery(function ($) {\n  $('.tabs').tabs();\n});\n```\n\nThere's several problems with this approach. First, you're running a selector against the document. This is unnecessary and can get slow in large DOMs even in the latest browsers. Second, it only gets executed on `DOMContentLoaded`. If you want to dynamically add some tabs to your document, then you've got to manually call that again once they've been added to the DOM.\n\nWith Skate, those problems vanish. No selectors are run and your tabs will automatically be initialised regardless of when they are put into the document.\n\nTo refactor that into a Skate component, all you need to do is:\n\n```js\nvar typeClass = require('skatejs-type-class');\n\nskate('tabs', {\n  type: typeClass,\n  created: function (element) {\n    jQuery(element).tabs();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nPossibly the best part about this is that you don't need to touch any markup and only a minimal amount of JavaScript.\n\n\n\n## Native Support\n\nIf your component is bound via custom tags and your browser supports custom elements then Skate will use the native DOM implementation instead of using Mutation Observers which will have added performance benefits. This all happens underneath the hood and the API does not change.\n\n\n\n## Polyfills\n\nAs you may know, the only way to polyfill Mutation Observers is to use the deprecated DOM 3 Mutation Events. They were deprecated because if you insert 5k elements at once, you then trigger 5k handlers at once. Mutation Observers will batch that into a single callback.\n\nSkate requires that you BYO your own [Mutation Observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) implementation. There are several out there:\n\n- https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs (requires WeakMap polyfill)\n- https://github.com/megawac/MutationObserver.js\n- https://github.com/bitovi/mutationobserver\n\n\n\n## Preventing FOUC\n\nAn element may not be initialised right away. To prevent FOUC, you can add the `unresolved` attribute to any web component element and then use that attribute to hide the element in your stylesheets.\n\n```html\n<style>\n  [unresolved] {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n</style>\n<my-element unresolved></my-element>\n```\n\nThe `unresolved` attribute will be removed after the `created()` callback is called and before the `attached()` callback is called.\n\nAdditionally, after removing the `unresolved` attribute, Skate will add the `resolved` attribute. This allows you to transition your styles:\n\n```css\n[resolved] {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transition: opacity .3s ease;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Ignoring Elements\n\nIf you have a DOM tree that you don't want Skate to polyfill then you can add the `data-skate-ignore` attribute. This is ideal for mitigating performance issues associated with older browsers and inspecting each element that is added to the document. Generally this is only an issue in Internet Explorer and dealing with hundreds of thousands of elements. If your browser natively supports Custom Elements then this attribute is ignored.\n\n```html\n<div data-skate-ignore>\n  <!-- Everything including the container will be ignored. -->\n</div>\n```\n\n\n\n## No Conflict\n\nSkate has a `noConflict()` method that we have come to expect from libraries that may come into conflict with the same name, or multiple versions of itself. It returns the new `skate` while restoring the global `skate` to the previous value.\n\n```js\nvar mySkate = skate.noConflict();\n```\n\n\n\n## Multiple Version Support\n\nOn top of offering a no-conflict mode, Skate plays well with multiple versions of itself on the same page. Prior to version `0.11` Skate did not share a registry or mutation observers. `0.11` and later share a registry and a mutation observer. This means that trying to register the same component in `0.11` and `0.12` would result in an error. Sharing a mutation observer ensures that we don't have more than main mutation observer on the page scanning incoming elements which helps with performance.\n",
